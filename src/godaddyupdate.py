# Description:
#     This module connects to GoDaddy through their API,
#     Gets the DNS Records that need updated from a JSON file
#     Gets the Domains for the DNS Records from a JSON file
#     finds the public IP address of the ISP that the script is running behind
#     For each Domain, grabs the current DNS A Records
#     For each DNS A Records in the domain it finds a match for the DNS Record
#     Then updates the DNS A Records ip address with the public isp ip address
